= DRAKE -- Distributed Rake

A branch of Rake supporting parallel task execution.

== Synopsis

Run up to three tasks in parallel:

  % drake -j3

or equivalently,

  % drake --threads 3

== Installation

  % gem install drake

== Notes

=== Compatibility

Drake is 100% compatible with Rake.  The code path for
<tt>--threads=1</tt> is effectively identical to that of Rake's.
Drake passes all of Rake's unit tests, with any number of threads from
1 to 1000 (the most tested).

=== Dependencies

In a given Rakefile, it is possible (even likely) that the
dependency tree has not been properly defined.  Consider

   task :a => [:x, :y, :z]

With single-threaded Rake, _x_,_y_,_z_ will be invoked <em>in that
order</em> before _a_ is invoked (assuming there are no other rules
involving these tasks).  However with <code>drake -jN</code> (for +N+
> 1), one should not expect any particular order of execution.  Since
there is no dependency specified between _x_,_y_,_z_ above, Drake is
free to run them in any order.

If you wish _x_,_y_,_z_ to be invoked sequentially, then write

   task :a => seq[:x, :y, :z]

This is shorthand for

   task :a => :z
   task :z => :y
   task :y => :x

Upon invoking _a_, the above rules say: "Can't do _a_ until _z_ is
complete; can't do _z_ until _y_ is complete; can't do _y_ until _x_
is complete; therefore do _x_."  In this fashion the sequence
_x_,_y_,_z_ is enforced.

The problem of insufficient dependencies plagues Makefiles as well,
and is sometimes called "not j-safe".

=== MultiTask

When more than one thread is given, +multitask+ behaves just like
+task+.  Those tasks which may properly be run in parallel will be run
in parallel; those which cannot, will not.  It is not the user's job
to decide.  In other words, for <tt>-jN</tt> (+N+ > 1), +multitask+ is
an alias of +task+.

For <tt>-j1</tt> (default), +multitask+ behaves as the original.

=== Task#invoke inside Task#invoke

Parallelizing code means surrendering control over the
micro-management of its execution.  Manually invoking tasks inside
other tasks is rather contrary to this notion, throwing a monkey
wrench into the system.  An exception will be raised when this is
attempted in multi-threaded mode.

=== Migrating to -j

First of all, do you want to bother with <tt>-j</tt>?  If you are
satisfied with your build time, then there is really no reason to use
it.

If on the other hand your build takes twenty minutes to complete, you
may be interested in investing some time getting the full dependency
tree correct in order to take advantage of multiple CPUs or cores.

Though Drake cannot fathom what <em>you</em> mean by a correct
dependency, there is a tool available which may help you get closer to
saying what you mean:

  % drake --rand[=SEED]

This will randomize the order of sibling prerequisites for each task.
When given the optional SEED string, it will call
<tt>srand(SEED.hash)</tt> to produce the same permutation each time.
The randomize option also disables +multitask+, making it a regular
+task+.  (In multi-threaded mode, +multitask+ is already a regular
+task+.)

Though this option may produce an error due to unspecified
dependencies, with SEED at least it will be an error which is exactly
the same on each run.  In addition you'll have the major debugging
advantage of using a single thread.

= RAKE -- Ruby Make -- <em>master branch</em>

Supporting Rake version: 0.8.4

This package contains Rake, a simple ruby build program with
capabilities similar to make.

Rake has the following features:

* Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
  standard Ruby syntax.  No XML files to edit.  No quirky Makefile
  syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)

* Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.

* Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.

* Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating
  file names and paths.

* A library of prepackaged tasks to make building rakefiles easier. For example,
  tasks for building tarballs, gems and RDoc output are provided.

* Supports parallel execution of tasks.


== Installation

=== Gem Installation

Download and install  rake with the following.

   gem install rake

=== Normal Installation

You can download the source tarball of the latest version of Rake from

* http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50

Extract the tarball and run

  % ruby install.rb

from its distribution directory.

== Usage

=== Simple Example

First, you must write a "Rakefile" file which contains the build rules. Here's
a simple example:

  task :default => [:test]
  
  task :test do
    ruby "test/unittest.rb"
  end

This Rakefile has two tasks:

* A task named "test", which - upon invocation - will run a unit test file in
  Ruby.
* A task named "default". This task does nothing by itself, but it has exactly
  one dependency, namely the "test" task. Invoking the "default" task will
  cause Rake to invoke the "test" task as well.

Running the "rake" command without any options will cause it to run the
"default" task in the Rakefile:

  % ls
  Rakefile     test/
  % rake
  (in /home/some_user/Projects/rake)
  ruby test/unittest.rb
  ....unit test output here...

Type "rake --help" for all available options.

* CD into the top project directory of rake.
* Type one of the following:

     rake                  # If you have a version of rake installed
     ruby -Ilib bin/rake   # If you do not have a version of rake installed.
